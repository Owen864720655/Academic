## Personal Information

I received the Ph.D degree in Automatic Control from Peking University, Beijing, China in 2016. My research interests were mainly the block-oriented nonlinear system identification and its application. During the Ph.D career, I have published 5 SCI journal papers and 4 EI conference papers. My dissertation is entitled *On Block-Oriented Nonlinear Systems with Application to Control Valves*.

Currently I am an algorithm engineer in Huawei Technology Co., Ltd.
